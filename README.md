How do I approach designing software?

I think the most important aspect of software design is understanding the problem you're trying to solve before you even touch the code. That goes applies to both the problem and the solution you're proposing. I think it's important to lay out how you're going to attempt to solve this problem as your first thing. Something like a storyboard. Once the problem and solution are understood, I like to go little by litte, testing as I go to ensure things are functioning well enough. Creating test modules is a good strategy. I also like to make my code as modular as possible. That is, the program should allow for reusability of code for optimization. 




How do I approach developing programs?


As stated above, I think having a solid understanding of the code you're trying to create. Doing a wait-and-see with these things often results in clutter and a bad program. This project was no exception. There are so many header files and additional .cpp files that I'm not sure it would be possible to to understand the program without thoroughly understanding every module. That mirrors my experience with this course. I found it to be very overwhelming and difficult, until I took the time to study every module, and how they were interacting to create a 3D scene. 



How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?


I kind of touched on this above, but I tried to kind of streamroll through this at first, and found it very overwhelming and confusing. Until I took the time to kind of understand how the parts were interacting with each other, I didn't quite get the hang of things. By taking some time before each milestone to understand the new materials, and implement them accordingly, the milestones became easier and easier. By the time of the projects completion, I found it rather easy to add and remove different shapes where I needed them. 


Thank you for reading!
